I'll get this project cleaned up soon, for now the important parts are:
/CPPfiles: Containing all the c++ code
/Main: Containing main.cpp
/build: Where all the building happens

Build process:
If on Linux with cmake installed see "easyLinuxBuild" (and g++ and make, omitted due to ubiquity)

Otherwise enter "build" directory and enter following:
	cmake ..
	make
	./main
if all goes well.
